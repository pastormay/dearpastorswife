Dear Pastor’s wife,

<!--StartFragment-->

I feel that being pastor&#8217;s kids can bring a lot of pressure on our children, if we don’t do anything to manage things well. Don’t tell your kids that they are an example to all the children in the church. What a weight of responsibility to shoulder as a young child! Remember that you heard ‘the call’ or your husband heard ‘the call’ and answered the call. Your children found themselves in this situation without asking for it. Of course, it is not a bad situation. We know that answering God’s call is one of the best things that could have happened in our lives. We also know that the call comes with its share of sacrifices. There’s a demand placed on us as Pastor&#8217;s wives. There is a demand that the call places on our entire family, including our children as well. We don’t want to create an extra burden by adding the pressure of being an example to every other person’s child on our children.

I remember several years ago, a member of our church in Chicago corrected my son about something and then added, ‘Don’t you know you are an example to all the children in the church?’ I felt very uncomfortable about that. I appreciated the correction but I wish she hadn’t added that part. Why? It is because I just don’t believe in it. I don’t believe this one child needs to stop being himself just because he needs to act a certain way for every other person’s benefit. I believe in raising, normal, well-rounded kids. I believe in raising kids who will grow up to be responsible adults. That is why I will say your focus should be raising your child to be the best possible version of himself or herself. Don’t hold them up to unrealistic expectations.&nbsp; It is important to create an environment where it is safe for them to make mistakes, rise and do better next time. If we expect perfection from children then they may begin to pretend when they are with us. They could be one way in front of us and another when we are not there. Of course, we may not be able to completely avoid this but we can minimize those tendencies by being more realistic in our expectations.

For example, my son is 16 years old. If there are things a responsible 16- year old, whom I believe will grow up to be a God-fearing, God-loving man should not do, then, I train him not to do those things. Not because he is a pastor’s child but because that is exactly how I would train him even if he wasn’t a pastor’s child. So, the bottom line is that we let our children be children. We let them be normal. If there is anything that we need to correct, we do so. If there is any training that needs to happen, we endeavor to train them to the best of our ability while relying on God’s help. We should not treat them like they are or expect them to be superhuman because they are pastor’s kids.

Dear Pastor’s wife, I believe God with you for the grace to raise exceptional children who will stand out and make a difference in their generation. If you have enjoyed this issue of ‘Dear Pastor’s Wife’, please subscribe to the Dear Pastor’s Wife YouTube Channel. The link to do so is below;
