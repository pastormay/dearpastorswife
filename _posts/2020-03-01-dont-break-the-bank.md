Dear Pastor’s wife,

We are exposed to people from varied financial and economic backgrounds. Some people will come to church who are more financially comfortable than we are. Others will come to church who have less. I have seen people who are usually quite content and not given to competitive jealousy, get under pressure when their children are involved. People want to give their kids the best and sometimes stress themselves out when they cannot afford to give their kids things that others can. As pastors, we all want to give our children the best but we have to watch it in this area.

What I am talking about can range from clothes to extracurricular activities to even the school you can or cannot afford to send your kids to. We walk by faith and not by sight. Your current status is not your ‘forever’ status. What you are right now is not what you will forever be. Maybe you would like your children to go to a better school or you would like to be able to afford your children a house in a better neighborhood so that your children can have access to better resources. Those are all good faith goals. We should always have faith goals; a better place in life that you are releasing your faith to get to. That is the Christian life.

In the interim, don’t break the bank trying to keep up with the ‘Joneses’. You may not be able to give your children everything you would like to give them now but don’t stress over that. Give them what you can and that doesn’t always have to involve money. Many valuable things in life don’t have to do with money. There are so many things we can and should invest in our children such as developing a culture of God’s word, values, respect for others, believing in themselves beyond what money can buy and discovering their destinies in God.

Learn to trust in God where your children are concerned. Trust that what He has provided is what they need for this phase of their lives. Believe that what is needed for the next phase will be provided before they get there. Also let your children feel like once they are in God’s plan and God’s will for their lives, they have everything they need.

People allow pressure to build in their homes because of what others have that they feel they ought to have also. I know a couple that used to fight because the wife felt that their daughter did not have nice clothes like other girls her age at their church. She made such a big deal of it. I believe what had happened was that she had allowed the devil to build a stronghold and make such a bigger deal about it than was needed. You know what you can or cannot afford. Don’t live a life you can’t afford in a bid to live up to a certain standard. This pressure can be especially pronounced for the pastor’s family. If you can’t afford the dance or swimming lessons then don’t put yourself under pressure to make them happen.

Don’t get me wrong. I am not saying you should neglect your children. I am not advocating for your children looking shabby or unkempt. I am not saying we shouldn’t pay attention to the mental and physical well-being of our children. However, you make matters worse by pinning for things you can’t have now. Deal with jealousy and covetousness. Others in the church may have things you can’t afford for your children. That is okay. Deal with it. Maintain a healthy heart. Give the best you can but avoid the temptation to compete. Let God bless you where you are at. The blessing of the Lord brings wealth and adds no sorrow. Don’t cut yourself through with many sorrows because of the things you cannot&nbsp;afford.

I’ll end with Hebrews 13:5 ‘Let your conduct be without covetousness; be content with such things as you have. For God has said, “I will never leave nor forsake you.” Don’t live a covetous life even when it comes to your children.

Dear Pastor’s wife, I believe God’s beauty will be revealed in increasing measures over your family. God Bless You.
