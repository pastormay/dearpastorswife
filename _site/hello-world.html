<p>People choose their pastors but not their pastor’s wives. So, many times a pastor’s wife finds herself trying to adapt not only to her husband (who God has equipped her to adapt to) but also to the many people who have chosen him to be their pastor, as she wants to be that woman they would have chosen if they had the choice. Years down the line, she doesn’t even recognize herself anymore. My advise is that if you don’t recognize yourself anymore, you’ve bent so much that you are bent out of shape, you don’t know what your voice sounds like anymore because it has taken different tones to please so many people, then maybe take a pause. The best you is the you God created you to be. You count for something, you are special in His sight. The greatest blessing you can give is the gift of yourself. Yes, let Him refine you but let Him refine you to be a better you not an amalgamate.</p>

<p>I hope to minister hope to you through the articles on this blog. I will have a spirit-inspired, encouraging article for you every month. I will be talking about issues that maybe other people don’t understand because they don’t walk in our shoes so their life experiences may be very different. I will also be releasing a video message with each blog post. So, stay tuned, there are exciting times ahead. The first edition comes out in January.</p>

<p>Rooting for You,</p>

<p>Pastor May</p>
