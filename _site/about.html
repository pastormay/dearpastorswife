  <h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10: 25 …not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.</p>

<p>We may not be able to meet together physically but we can meet together here.</p>

<p><img src="img/about.png" alt="Emerald" title="DPW" /></p>

<h3 id="vision">Vision</h3>
<p>Dear Pastor’s Wife is a vision that was born in Pastor May Ijisesan’s heart to offer encouragement to pastors’ wives. As the pastor’s wife ministers to others, who ministers to her? Who encourages her? Who does she turn to for help, for counsel, for advise? As she gives and gives and gives, who waters her back in return? The vision of Dear Pastor’s Wife is to be that watering hole that a pastor’s wife can turn to.</p>

<p>If you are a pastor’s wife, you can come here for help. You can come for community. You can come here to hangout. You can receive but you can also give to encourage someone else. You never know who your words can encourage just as I never know who my words can encourage. Let us join together to form a community where we can lift one another up.</p>

<p>So, sit back. Relax. Come back for fresh content regularly. Thank you for visiting this page.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
