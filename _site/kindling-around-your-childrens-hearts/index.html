		<p>Dear Pastor’s Wife,</p>

<p> Kindling is defined as easily combustible, small sticks or wigs used for starting a fire. You cannot decide for your children to follow Christ or be devoted to HIM but you can surround their hearts with kindling so that God can spark a flame more easily later on in their lives.</p>

<p>The conscious efforts we make to expose our children to the things of God at an early age all help to surround their hearts with kindling. Some of those efforts may include the following;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Taking them to church: This may seem like a no brainer but not everyone realizes the importance of developing a culture of church attendance in children. Our relationship with God is indeed top priority but that should not preclude our regular attendance of church meetings, church services and fellowship opportunities with other believers from our local church. The concept of belonging to a local church needs to be real with our children.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Live the Word: Taking your children to church will not do a lot of good if you don’t live out the word before them. Whatever you do speaks louder than what you say. Of course, we are human beings with natural tendencies and imperfections. Our children will definitely see those aspects but then, let them also see someone committed to the word, who believes the word and who sees the word as the final authority.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Listen to your children: You need to pay attention to your children to see what is going into them that needs to be corrected. By listening to them, you know the lies the devil is trying to plant in their hearts. That way, you can debunk those lies and get them established in the word. It is not just important that we talk to our children; it is also important that we listen to what they have to say.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Help them to stay engaged and productive: When my children were younger, I tried as much as possible to make sure there were always books to read, workbooks to complete, audiobooks to listen to or some other things to keep them engaged and productive. You don’t have to invest a lot of money on this; you just have to be creative. You need to realize that this is important because your children are spirits, they have a soul and live in a body. The minds of your children shouldn’t be left idle. For Pastor’s wives who spend so much time in church, you can keep your children engaged with productive activities. It may not seem to be an obvious way to keep their hearts surrounded by kindling but then, it is.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protect the hearts of your children from hurt and offense. As a Pastor or Pastor’s wife, live your life and learn to move past hurts and offenses. Sometimes, someone who used to be there, who was a part of your life or maybe a part of your children’s lives may suddenly not be there any longer. You may be hurt by church members’ actions but as much as possible, don’t let your children see this, especially when they are younger. Protect your children’s hearts from hurt and offense. As they grow older, it may be more difficult to keep certain things from them but they will be more mature by then and can handle weightier things of life. Protecting their hearts will make it easier for God to spark a flame later on and also help them to believe the best of people.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Children are very precious. They mustn’t become collateral damage as we go about the work of ministry. They have been given to us to be cared for, nurtured and given a healthy exposure to God. May God help us as we endeavor to do this in Jesus’ Name.</p>

<p>Dear Pastor’s wife, I believe in you and I pray that you rise to be all that God has called you to be in Jesus’ Name.</p>
