<p>Dear Pastor’s Wife</p>

<p>Several years ago, the Lord laid this word on my heart as the theme for our Women’s Conference that year. At that time, I didn’t know what it meant. Most times I don’t know what the themes for our women’s conferences mean until God starts expounding on them. He often shows me by revelation and life experiences until I understand what He is saying to the women. He was telling me that year that women ought to occupy their places in the home, in ministry, in business, in career, in politics, in society or wherever they may be called to.</p>

<p>So, dear pastor’s wife, my encouragement for you today is that you occupy. Don’t just occupy space. Some people occupy space and that’s just a waste of space. Occupy your place. What are those things God has spoken to your heart? Where are those spaces He has asked you to venture into? You ought to begin to occupy. Step into your place and stay there. Don’t let people, circumstances or the devil displace you from your place.</p>

<p>Much like when you take an International flight. Sometimes, you feel such a strong urge to use the bathroom, you stand up from your seat and rush to the nearest bathroom, hoping when you get there, the sign on the door will read vacant. It is always very frustrating to get there and see that sign read “occupied’. It means that space is taken and no other person is allowed in. The same way, when people run to try and take up places assigned for your life and destiny, make sure that when they get there, the sign reads, ‘occupied’. If you don’t occupy your place, the simple truth is that others will attempt to. Quite alright, no one can do it as well as you were designed to do it. No one has the skill set, experience, divine design that it takes to occupy your place but if you don’t, another will.</p>

<p>What does this mean in practical terms? It means you should always be striving to be all that God has called you to be. When God places something on your heart, don’t say – someone else will do it. God made us all original. There is no counterfeit. None is redundant. You need to be about your Father’s business.</p>

<p>In Luke 19:13, Jesus was telling a parable about a nobleman who was going to a far country and gave his servants a command to occupy until He came back. That phrase also means, ‘Do business until I come’. In much the same way, Jesus has given a commandment to occupy until He comes. Let your impact be felt. Let your world know you were here. Let your space in life and destiny read – occupied. God Bless You.</p>
