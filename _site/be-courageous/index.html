		<p>Dear Pastor’s Wife,</p>

<p>As a woman of God, you will always need to be courageous to do all that God has called you to do. But don’t worry; courage is just embracing what God says you are. He takes over from there. You see God will speak to the real you. He will call for the person He knows that He has made you be. When your outward self reflects who your inward self is, then you will do things that you once thought were impossible. That is why what God says about you is so important. What God says about you calls out the real person. Maybe you are covered up in shame, insecurity or poor self-esteem. That is not really who you are. That may be what you have become on the outside because of what people have said about you, the mistakes you have made or perhaps what your life experiences have been. That’s why God will address you as a mighty woman of valor even when you don’t feel like it. He will call you a world-changer when you don’t feel like you can change anything. Courage is embracing that word and when you do, God changes you into the kind of person who changes her world.</p>

<p>Remember Gideon in the bible? He felt like the least of everything. The last thing he saw himself as was someone that could be used to deliver Israel but an angel appeared to Him and called him a mighty man of valor. He didn’t quite accept that word initially but when he finally did, he became that man who did what he thought was impossible but God had designed him to do all along.</p>

<p>What are you going to become and what ‘impossible’ things are you going to do once you accept what God is saying about you? Will you be a woman who changes other people’s lives? Will you be one who helps others to heal from abuse? Will you be the woman who starts an initiative that helps others? Or will you be the woman that preaches the gospel all over the world? Great things await you on the other side of courage.</p>

<p>Dear Pastor’s wife, what is holding you back? Don’t think too little of yourself. Many years ago, the Lord told me that ‘Pastor’s wife’ is not a five-fold ministry office. Yes, it is an important supporting function but it may not be all that God has called you to be. So, you have a responsibility before God to continually seek His face to hear what He is saying about you. When you stand before God, you will be held accountable for not only what you did in fulfilling your role as a Pastor’s wife but also what you did in pursuing your unique destiny. That is why I like to say that a woman has a two-fold call and she is doubly graced for it. So, be courageous. There will be times you will feel the fear. Courage is not the absence of fear but it is moving on in spite of the fear you feel. Courage is moving forward because you are paying more attention to what God is saying to you about you rather than what the fear or situation is telling you about you. Following God will always require courage because God is always talking about bigger things for the future. In God, your future is always going to be greater than your past. I believe in you. I believe in what you can do. I believe in the impact you can make.</p>

<p>Dear Pastor’s Wife, arise and be courageous. What God is always saying about your future is greater than what you have seen in the past.</p>
