Dear Pastor&#8217;s Wife,

Do you remember the fairytale _Snow White_? Snow white is about a beautiful young lady and her stepmother. The stepmother was an evil queen who had a magical mirror in her room. Every morning she would stand in front of this mirror and ask, ‘Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?’ For many years, the response was, &#8216;You Are.&#8217; Every time she asked, the mirror would reaffirm what she wanted to hear. ‘You Are’, It would say. Well, one day she stood in the same position, in front of that mirror and for the first time, the mirror responded, ‘You are not.’ She was enraged. Who could it be then? If she wasn’t the fairest, the most wonderful, the most celebrated and most admired, who then was? Well, she asked the mirror and it showed her the image of a girl she knew too well. The mirror showed her the image of her stepdaughter. The queen got so angry. She got so jealous that she began an evil plot to get rid of snow-white. Well, maybe I’ll finish this story another time.

There used to be a time when ministry was simpler. When being you was just enough. There was a time when you didn’t feel like you had to look like a thousand bucks to leave your house, especially on Sunday morning. Your make up did not have to be on point and your hair did not have to be on fleek. Not that you didn’t put any effort into making sure you looked decent but that wasn’t something you put so much focus on. Now, the pressure seems so much. You need to have on a very nice dress and very nice shoes and very nice hair or very nice makeup and very nice whatever else…. Do you feel under pressure to look &#8216;the best&#8217; for every service? I&#8217;m not just talking about looking your best. I&#8217;m talking about getting under pressure to look the fairest &#8216;out of them all.&#8217;

Mirror, Mirror on the wall, you may not be fairest of them all and this goes beyond how we look. Even in how we perceive ourselves. You don’t have to be the most ‘powerful’ woman in the congregation. I know we sometimes use the term ‘first lady’ to refer to the pastor’s wife but being called the first lady should not pressure us into thinking we are the first or the best at anything. Don’t get me wrong. This doesn’t mean we should debase ourselves. It doesn’t mean we should have a less than stellar esteem of ourselves but we shouldn’t set ourselves up to be threatened by the fact that other people, especially ladies in our church might be prettier, better dressed, more intelligent, more resourceful or better admired than we are.

Mirror, mirror on the wall, you may not be the fairest of them all and that’s okay. Work on being the best character-wise; the best in loving and the best in patience. The best at things that make other people’s lives better. Remember what the bible says in 1 Peter 3:5 &#8211; In summary, it says we shouldn’t merely be about how we are adorned or how our hair is plaited or what type of jewelry we have on but we should be more focused on the way we are ‘dressed’ on the inside. We should have on the unfading charm of a gentle and peaceful spirit which is very precious in the sight of God. It just leads to a more peaceful, fulfilling and joyful life. Period!

Dear Pastor’s wife, I believe that your inner beauty will emerge in this season and your world will be blessed by that. If you have enjoyed this issue of ‘Dear Pastor’s Wife’ please subscribe to the Dear Pastor’s wife YouTube channel. The link to do so is below;
