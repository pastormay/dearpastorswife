	  	<p>Dear Pastor’s Wife Several years ago, the Lord laid this word on my heart as the theme for our Women’s Conference that year. At that time, I didn’t know what it meant. Most times I don’t know what the themes for our women’s conferences mean until God starts expounding on...</p>

	  	<p>Dear Pastor’s Wife, As a woman of God, you will always need to be courageous to do all that God has called you to do. But don’t worry; courage is just embracing what God says you are. He takes over from there. You see God will speak to the real...</p>

	  	<p>Dear Pastor’s Wife, Do you remember the fairytale Snow White? Snow white is about a beautiful young lady and her stepmother. The stepmother was an evil queen who had a magical mirror in her room. Every morning she would stand in front of this mirror and ask, ‘Mirror, mirror on...</p>

	  	<p>Dear Pastor’s wife, We are exposed to people from varied financial and economic backgrounds. Some people will come to church who are more financially comfortable than we are. Others will come to church who have less. I have seen people who are usually quite content and not given to competitive...</p>

	  	<p>Dear Pastor’s wife, I feel that being pastor’s kids can bring a lot of pressure on our children, if we don’t do anything to manage things well. Don’t tell your kids that they are an example to all the children in the church. What a weight of responsibility to shoulder...</p>

	  	<p>Dear Pastor’s Wife,  Kindling is defined as easily combustible, small sticks or wigs used for starting a fire. You cannot decide for your children to follow Christ or be devoted to HIM but you can surround their hearts with kindling so that God can spark a flame more easily later...</p>

	  	<p>People choose their pastors but not their pastor’s wives. So, many times a pastor’s wife finds herself trying to adapt not only to her husband (who God has equipped her to adapt to) but also to the many people who have chosen him to be their pastor, as she wants...</p>
